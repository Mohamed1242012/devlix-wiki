# Installation

> This will cover the installation process of Devlix and how to set it up.

?> The installation guid is currently manual but there will be an installer script in the future

## Prerequisites

?> I will assume this is a new minimal Arch Linux installation

!> If you want to run Devlix on a Virtual Machine ensure that 3d acceleration is turned on, without it the Virtual Machine will freeze every time you open it

### Set the terminal color based on a background image

We have added some good looking wallpapers in our repository in this directory `devlix/wallpapers/[img name]` but you can put also any other wallpaper in any directory.

```

?> For more information read the official [Oh My Zsh documentation](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki)

### Install some useful `zsh` plugins

These plugins add some functionality to zsh and make it more efficient and easier to use, an example of this are these plugins.

- zsh-autosuggestions
    - This gives auto suggestions for the past commands you wrote and increases speed so you don't type any command again and again
    - For more information about zsh-autosuggestions read it's [`README.md` file on GitHub](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- zsh-syntax-highlighting
    - This gives you syntax highlighting in the commands you type
    - For more information about zsh-syntax-highlighting read it's [`README.md` file on GitHub](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

To install them enter these commands in your terminal

!> You should enter `zsh` before installing these plugins for them to be installed in the right directory

?> It's OK to see some errors when you enter zsh and they will be fixed once you install the [plugins](#install-some-useful-zsh-plugins) and the [`PowerLevel10k` theme](#install-powerlevel10k-theme-on-zsh)

```bash
# If you miss this command the plugins will not be installed in there right directory
zsh

# zsh-autosuggestions - https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions

# zsh-syntax-highlighting - https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

### Install `Powerlevel10k` theme on `zsh`

> Powerlevel10k is a theme for Zsh. It emphasizes speed, flexibility and out-of-the-box experience.
>
> \- [Powerlevel10k README.md on GitHub](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

Powerlevel10k lets you customize the terminal to do somethings like this

![powerlevel10k](../pictures/powerlevel10k.png)
